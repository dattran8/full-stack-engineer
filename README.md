Welcome to the world of Django (pronounced like JANG-go with a silent D)!

Get introduced to an open-source web development framework supported by the Django Software Foundation. Django is written in Python and provides an opinionated approach to web development meaning you'll know how projects are structured and have a general set of guidelines for how to bring your apps to life. Django comes with a lot of tools already provided, so you can pick and choose what you need to get the job done.

## SQL and SQLite

Django can be configured with a relational database which you could use SQL to interact with — but you don’t need to!

## Models and Databases

Learn how models determine the schema for the database and how to perform all CRUD functionality in Django.

## Writing More Views

Let’s write some more views and see how Django can incorporate generics to make views even easier for developers.

## Forms

Incorporate forms in your Django app to get info from your users.

## Accounts and Authentication

CRUD functionality is now easier with an admin account! Also, learn to safeguard the rest of your app by having your users create accounts.
