# Build Python Web Apps with Django

Welcome to the world of Django (pronounced like JANG-go with a silent D)! Get introduced to an open-source web development framework supported by the Django Software Foundation. Django is written in Python and provides an opinionated approach to web development meaning you'll know how projects are structured and have a general set of guidelines for how to bring your apps to life. Django comes with a lot of tools already provided, so you can pick and choose what you need to get the job done.

## [Introduction to the Web](django-introduction-to-the-web)

Get an overview of the technology needed to create a Django web application.

**Reference**: [Full-Stack Engineer](https://github.com/datttrian/full-stack-engineer)

## [Introduction to Django](introduction-to-django)

Using your knowledge of Python, explore the world of web development!

**Project**: [Fortune Teller](introduction-to-django/fortuneteller)

## [Templates in Django](templates-in-django)

Learn how Django’s templates and template language (DTL) make it a breeze to incorporate logic into HTML and render dynamic pages to users.

**Project**: [Tourist Attractions with Templates](templates-in-django/touristAttractions)

## [Data in Django](data-in-django)

### SQL and SQLite

Django can be configured with a relational database which you could use SQL to interact with — but you don’t need to!

### Models and Databases

Learn how models determine the schema for the database and how to perform all CRUD functionality in Django.

**Project**: [Djaunty Rent-a-Bike](data-in-django/BikeRental)

## [Views in Django](views-in-django)

Let’s write some more views and see how Django can incorporate generics to make views even easier for developers.

**Project**: [The Django Djitney](views-in-django/djangodjitney)

## [Forms in Django](forms-in-django)

Incorporate forms in your Django app to get info from your users.

**Project**: [Tourist Attractions with Forms](forms-in-django/touristAttractions)
