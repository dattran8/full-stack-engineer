Welcome to the world of Django (pronounced like JANG-go with a silent D)!

Get introduced to an open-source web development framework supported by the Django Software Foundation. Django is written in Python and provides an opinionated approach to web development meaning you'll know how projects are structured and have a general set of guidelines for how to bring your apps to life. Django comes with a lot of tools already provided, so you can pick and choose what you need to get the job done.
