                <p>Daniel here! It seems like you landed here a couple of days too early. Right now, I am currently developing the very site you are looking at.</p>
                <p>I'm sorry you have to find out this site like this. You can instead appreciate the view to the earth from up here though. Look how stunning it looks.</p>
