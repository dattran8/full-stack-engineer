1. Download Node.js from the [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org "Download Node.js") website.
2. Once the download has finished run the installer.
3. When you have Node successfully installed, open a command line interface and change to the directory that contains the QuoteAPI application.
4. To start the server, type the following command:
