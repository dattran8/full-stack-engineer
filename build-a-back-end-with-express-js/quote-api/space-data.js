      fact: 'Mercury & Venus are the only 2 planets in our solar system that have no moons. In total, there are 176 confirmed moons that orbit the planets in our solar system, with some of them being bigger than Mercury itself!'
    },
    {
      fact: "If a star passes too close to a black hole, it can be torn apart. For 20 years, a team of astronomers observed a star at the center of our galaxy orbiting a black hole. The star has now got close enough to the black hole for “gravitational redshift” to occur which is where the star's light loses energy as the black hole's gravity intensified."
    },
    {
      fact: "The hottest planet in our solar system is Venus. Most people think that this would be Mercury, as it is the closest planet to the sun. However, Venus has a lot of gasses in its atmosphere which creates a “Greenhouse Effect” that causes a constant temperature of 864° Fahrenheit (462° Celsius) everywhere on the planet's surface."
    },
    {
      fact: 'Our solar system is 4.57 billion years old. Well, give or take 30 million years(ish). Accurately speaking, it is 4.571 billion years old. Scientists estimate that in about 5 billion years, our Sun will expand becoming a Red Giant. In about 7.5 billion years its expanding surface will swallow up and engulf the Earth.'
    },
    {
      fact: "Enceladus, one of Saturn's smaller moons, reflects 90% of the Sun's light. Because Enceladus' icy surface reflects sunlight rather than absorbing it, temperatures reach as low as -394° Fahrenheit (-201° Celsius)."
    },
    {
      fact: "The highest mountain discovered is the Olympus Mons, which is located on Mars. Its peak is 16 miles (25 km) high, making it nearly 3 times higher than Mount Everest. And not only is it tall, but it's also 374,015 ft² (114,000 m²) wide - that's an area the size of Arizona!"
    },
    {
      fact: 'The Milky Way galaxy is 105,700 light-years wide. It would take a modern spacecraft 450,000,000 years to travel to the center of our galaxy!'
    },
    {
      fact: 'Because of lower gravity, a person who weighs 220 lbs on Earth would weigh 84 lbs on Mars. When sending droids to the surface of Mars, this is something scientists plan for, being able to load the droid up with more equipment and build it from more robust materials.'
    },
    {
      fact: 'The Martian day is 24 hours 39 minutes and 35 seconds long. Because Mars orbits the sun slower than the Earth, there are actually 687 Martian days in a Martian year!'
    },
    {
      fact: "Due to the Sun and Moon's gravitational pull, we have tides. This is because the Moon's tidal force causes the Earth - and the water on it - to bulge out on the side closest to the Moon."
