<p class="p__1qg33Igem5pAgn4kPMirjw">The “Lite” part of SQLite’s name implies that it’s a lightweight database perfect for small, personal applications. The other portion “<em>SQL</em>“, pronounced like the word “sequel”, refers to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">Structured Query Language</a> which is used to interact with the database. But, as part of Django’s “swiss army knife” approach, developers can still interact with their databases even without knowing SQL because of Django’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping">Object-Relational Mapping</a>, or <em>ORM</em>. Simply speaking, we’re able to write Python code to interact with our SQLite database! </p>

We will describe what it does and its main uses. While you don’t need to learn SQL for Django, it’s helpful to get an overview of what it does and how it works with SQLite. </p>
<h2 id="heading-what-is-sqlite" class="h2__1Ly_Sza5xVS3yZl46_StcN">What is SQLite?</h2>
<p class="p__1qg33Igem5pAgn4kPMirjw">SQLite is a database engine. It is software that allows users to interact with a relational database. In SQLite, a database is stored in a single file — a trait that distinguishes it from other database engines. This fact allows for a great deal of accessibility: copying a database is no more complicated than copying the file that stores the data, sharing a database can mean sending an email attachment.</p>
<h3 id="heading-drawbacks-to-sqlite" class="h3__3B1DSzXTW-ux1viDSStOux">Drawbacks to SQLite</h3>
<p class="p__1qg33Igem5pAgn4kPMirjw">SQLite’s signature portability unfortunately makes it a poor choice when many different users are updating the table at the same time (to maintain integrity of data, only one user can write to the file at a time). It also may require some more work to ensure the security of private data due to the same features that make SQLite accessible. Furthermore, SQLite does not offer the same exact functionality as many other database systems, limiting some advanced features other relational database systems offer. Lastly, SQLite does not validate data types. Many other database software would reject data that does not conform to a table’s <em>schema</em>, how a table’s data is organized. However, SQLite allows users to store data of any type into any column. </p>
<p class="p__1qg33Igem5pAgn4kPMirjw">SQLite creates schemas, which constrain the type of data in each column, but it does not enforce them. The example below shows that the id column expects to store integers, the name column expects to store text, and the age column expects to store integers:</p>
<pre class="pre__3_SOs7YT7NaHjnNunEArSM"><pre><code><div data-lang="codecademy-sql" class="gamut-1oq8wcb-ColorizedContainer e1hgti5c0"><span><span class="mtk12">CREATE</span><span class="mtk1"> </span><span class="mtk12">TABLE</span><span class="mtk1"> celebs </span><span class="mtk4">(</span></span><br><span><span class="mtk1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;id INTEGER, </span></span><br><span><span class="mtk1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name TEXT, </span></span><br><span><span class="mtk1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;age INTEGER</span></span><br><span><span class="mtk4">)</span><span class="mtk1">;</span></span><br></div></code></pre></pre>
<p class="p__1qg33Igem5pAgn4kPMirjw">However, SQLite will not reject values of the wrong type. We could accidentally insert the wrong data types in the columns. Storing different data types in the same column is a bad habit that can lead to errors that are difficult to fix, so it’s important to be strict about your schema even though SQLite will not enforce it.</p>
<h3 id="heading-uses-for-sqlite" class="h3__3B1DSzXTW-ux1viDSStOux">Uses for SQLite</h3>
<p class="p__1qg33Igem5pAgn4kPMirjw">Even considering the drawbacks, the benefits of being able to access and manipulate a database without involving a server application are huge. SQLite is used worldwide for testing, development, and in any other scenario where it makes sense for the database to be on the same disk as the application code. SQLite’s maintainers consider it to be among the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0" href="https://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html">most replicated pieces of software in the world</a>. </p>
