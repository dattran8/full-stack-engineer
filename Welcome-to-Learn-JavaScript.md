In this course, you will learn programming fundamentals with JavaScript syntax. The concepts covered in this course lay the foundation for using JavaScript in any environment.</p>
<p>
After this course, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>

<li>
implement JavaScript data types, built-in methods, and variables</li>
<li>
use conditionals to control the flow of a program in JavaScript</li>
<li>
construct functions and pass data through them</li>
<li>
identify global and block-level scopes in JavaScript</li>
<li>
use arrays to store lists of data</li>
<li>
use loops to execute blocks of code multiple times</li>
<li>
use iterator methods to simplify the process of looping over arrays</li>
<li>
use JavaScript ES6 object syntax to model real-world items</li>
</ul>
<p>
Learning is social. Whatever you’re working on, be sure to connect with the Codecademy community in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener">
forums</a>. Remember to check in with the community regularly, including for things like asking for code reviews on your project work and providing code reviews to others in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener">
projects category</a>, which can help to reinforce what you’ve learned. </p>
